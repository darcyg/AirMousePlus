/* Introduction     REVIEW - HOW MUCH HERE - VS THE WIKI!!!!!!!
     Xinchejian Hackerspace Shanghai Assistive Devices project aims to create
 many assistive devices that are easily customised to an individuals needs.
 Assistive Devices are anything, physical, electronic or software to help people accomplish everyday tasks.

 All information including assembly details are at: http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Assistive_Devices

 The projects are open source and everyone is encourage to contribute to the hardware, the software,
 the documentation (in many languages) and especially in using the devices.

 This sub-project aims to create an "Air mouse" or "wand" that is:-
 - small, lightweight
 - can be used by different parts of the body,
        including finger, wrist, arm, head, foot.
 - be highly configurable and customisable to meet an indivuals needs
 - relatively cheap and easy to get all of the parts

 It uses gyros and accelerometers to create an air-mouse, or wand to control a computers mouse.

While there are commercial devices for this purpose, but they tend to be less configurable.
This project aims to give this device MANY more features than most (all?) current commercial devices!

// TODO - review HERE & user config - terms same and ALL included - nothing missing frm EITHER section
//?? merge the two sections? --- or keep this one as overview/intro
/* Air mouse capabilites / actions -  "what can you do with it?" - "How to use it?" - for a USER to read and understand!!!!!
ie they need to know how to use every feature!

 General how to info:
    - Sensor has to be aligned correctly with your body.
        eg for finger/wrist/arm mouse align marker to point at tip of limb.
    - Initially, try to aim or point the sensor at computer screen.
    - For head mouse ... to be sorted out :)
    - Your mounting method (how you "wear" the sensor) should consider this and especially user comfort.

Configuration / customisation
    Note MANY features are optional and can be turned on/off in the code
    - see "USER CONFIGURATION" section
    - in (near?) future this will be done using a computer user configuration application

    Don't forget your operating system ALSO allows configuration of mouse & button behaviour.
    And if you are using any assistive software, it may also help adjust to meet indidvuals needs.

Mouse movement control
    - Rotational control: - rotate wrist for horizontal mouse control, tilt up/down for vertical mouse control
    - TODO needs to be added! Traditional linear mouse control using the air mouse
    - more - eg keyboard arrow control, but using real or virtual switches???

Mouse button control
    - currently a simple short horizontal shake = mouse left button down.
    - if installed & enabled used the physical switches as mouse buttons

Additional actions
    - a longer shake than "Left Mouse Button down" will alternately enable or diable mouse movement control
    - looking to add a LOT more tap/shake/gesture etc actions
        that can control more mouse buttons/scroll wheel and keyboard, .....

En/disable mouse movement
    - LOONGER shake will toggle the mouse MOVEMENT on/off - at present the virtual button/s are left enabled!

En/disable mouse buttons
    - only via the code at present.
