/* git - line endings ... related to wierdness been seeing??
https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings

Git will automatically manage line endings for you if you set the core.autocrlf option. On Windows, you usually want to use true for this setting.
    git config --global core.autocrlf true


Re-normalizing a repository

After you've set the core.autocrlf option and committed a .gitattributes file, you may find that git wants to commit files that you've not modified.
This is because git wants to normalize the line endings for you.
The best way to do this is wipe out your working tree (all the files except the .git directory) and then restore them.
****Make sure you've committed any work before you do this, or it will be lost.


$ git rm --cached -r .
# Remove everything from the index.

$ git reset --hard
# Write both the index and working directory from git's database.

$ git add .
# Prepare to make a commit by staging all the files that will get normalized.
# This is your chance to inspect which files were never normalized. You should
# get lots of messages like: "warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in file."

$ git commit -m "Normalize line endings"
# Commit

/* Introduction
     Xinchejian Hackerspace Shanghai Assistive Devices project aims to create
 many assistive devices that are easily customised to an individuals needs.
 Assistive Devices are anything, physical, electronic or software to help people accomplish everyday tasks.
 See http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Assistive_Devices

 The projects are open source and everyone is encourage to contribute to the hardware, the software,
 the documentation (in many languages) and especially in using the devices.

 This sub-project aims to create:-
 - a smaller, lighter device that can be used by several area of the body,
 including finger, wrist, arm, head, foot.
 - be highly configurable and customisable to meet an indivuals needs
 - relatively cheap and easy to get all of the parts

This program uses a gyros and accelerometers to create an air-mouse, or wand to control a computers mouse.

While there are commercial devices for this purpose, but they tend to be less configurable.
This project aims to give this device MANY more features than most (all?) current commercial devices!

*/



/* Air mouse capabilites / actions -  "what can you do with it?" - "How to use it?" - for a USER to read and understand!!!!!
ie they need to know how to use every feature!

 General how to info:
    - Sensor has to be aligned correctly with your body.
    - Try to aim or point the sensor at teh computer screen.
    - For finger/wrist/arm mouse align marker to point at tip of limb.
    - For head mouse ... to be sorted out :)

Configuration / customisation
    Note MANY features are optional and can be turned on/off in the code - see "USER CONFIGURATION" section
    - in near? future this will be done using a computer user configuration application

    Don't forget your operating system ALSO allows configuration of mouse & button behaviour.
    And if you are using any assistive software, it may also help adjust to meet indidvuals needs.

Mouse movement control
    - Rotational control: - rotate wrist for horizontal mouse control, tilt up/down for vertical mouse control
    - Traditional linear mouse control using the air mouse = TODO needs to be added!
    - more - eg keyboard arrow control, but using real or virtual switches???

Mouse button control
    - currently a simple short horizontal shake = mouse left button down.
    - if installed & enabled used the physical switches as mouse buttons

Additional actions
    - none yet but looking to add a LOT more tap/shake/gesture etc actions
        that can control more mouse buttons/scroll wheel and keyboard, .....

En/disable mouse movement
    - LOONGER shake will toggle the mouse MOVEMENT on/off - at present the virtual button/s are left enabled!

En/disable mouse buttons
    - only via the code at present.
